An essential function of health care provider organizations (HPO) participating in the All of Us Program is to 
locate local electronic health record (EHR) data of participants who have provided consent and to share these data 
with the program following guidance provided by the Data & Research Center (DRC). This document serves as the source
of this guidance. It contains the technical specifications that data sets must adhere to in order for submitting HPOs 
to receive proper credit for their enrollment achievements. It describes the expected format, structure and content of 
EHR data submissions and the standard procedures governing these data sets (e.g. the procedures by which HPOs are 
expected to send data sets to the program).

This document is intended primarily for personnel (who we refer to as _data stewards_) who hold the responsibility 
of submitting EHR data on behalf of HPOs.
